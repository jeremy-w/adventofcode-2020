# Advent of Code 2020

Jeremy W. Sherman

This year's language is: [**Mercury**](https://mercurylang.org/), which is like
a statically-typed Prolog with a focus on fast execution.

This year's challenges can be found at: https://adventofcode.com/2020

## Building & Running

`mmc` drops a lot of stuff in the current directory unless you pass `--use-subdirs`, so you'll want to:

```
# fish syntax
cd build/
set -x DAY 1
mmc --use-subdirs ../src/day$DAY.m && ./day$DAY < ../input/day$DAY.txt
```

There's probably some clever way to automate this with Make, but, meh.
